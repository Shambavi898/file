5. To-Do List
6. Weekly Planner

## Technical Specifications

- **Concurrency Model**: Event-loop optimized with Web Workers
- **Storage**: User-scoped IndexedDB with manual deletion only
- **Caching**: Service Worker with stale-while-revalidate strategy
- **Performance**: <100ms response time under simulated load
- **Dependencies**: Zero paid services or cloud dependencies
